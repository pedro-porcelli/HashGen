# HashMaps

Makes a hash with a hashmap and associates it with your name as a key to the hash value. Type git clone https://github.com/pedro-porcelli/HashGen.git. then you can import with import HashGen.hash.*;. To use the hash.HashSR() function type hash.HashSR("Your Full name here", YourHashMapHere); this goes for hash.HashRS() function. the hash.HashRS() function just makes the hash the key to the full_name value.
