# HashMaps

Makes a hash with a hashmap and associates it with your name as a key to the hash value. Type git clone https://github.com/pedro-porcelli/HashGen.git. then you can import with import HashGen.hash.\*;. To use the hash.HashSR() function type hash.HashSR("Your Full name here", YourHashMapHere); this goes for hash.HashRS() function. the hash.HashRS() function just makes the hashmap key to the full_name value.The new HashRSstring() function and the HashSRstring() function converts the random to a string. The hashmap needed for this function uses a string for the key and a string for the value.
